# Pleroma Mod Misskey Catears

This script adds catears to the users avatar, that meets certain requirements. i stole it partly from misskey. 
Sadly, we don't have a cat flag in our profiles in pleroma, so this script uses the displayname as well as the username to determine if a user is a cat or not.

## Install

do this in your pleroma-mods directory

```
sudo -u pleroma git clone https://github.com/absturztaube/pleroma-mod-catify.git
```

add `catify` to your pleroma-mod-loader config
